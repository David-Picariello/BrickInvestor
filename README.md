A order, inventory, and sales tracker that pairs with a Lego API to retrieve images and set information.

This project is written in Java and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to efficiently track and manage all necessary data for a Lego reselling business. It allows users to:
	•	Track inventory by storing details about Lego sets, including set numbers, names, conditions, and quantities.
	•	Monitor sales by recording transactions, profit margins, and customer details.
	•	Manage orders by keeping records of pending, completed, and canceled orders.
	•	Retrieve set information by integrating with a Lego API to automatically fetch images, descriptions, and release details.
	•	Generate reports and insights to analyze sales trends, inventory turnover, and profit calculations.

The application leverages data structures for efficient storage, file handling for data persistence, and API integration for real-time Lego set details. It is designed to streamline the reselling process by reducing manual data entry and improving tracking accuracy.
